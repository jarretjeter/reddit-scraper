Parker, Povetkin and Rivas are better wins than almost all current HWs have on their CV and even Browne and Allen are good wins at the time he got them.

      "He’s been completely written off and overhated for years,(the hate for Joshua is actually mental, I haven’t seen a fighter get as much hate since Floyd but in AJ’s case it was entirely undeserved) but since recent that’s started to change, and slowly more and more people are starting to look at him for the fighter he is, and not for what he’s labeled as. \n",

      "Object: Who is in the running for fighter of the year?\n",
      "SELFTEXT: We're just over half way through the year and between the fights that have already happened and what is currently scheduled we should have a pretty good idea of what we're looking at toward the years end. So, who do you think will end up as fighter of the year? I've got a few candidates in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Crawford/Indongo winner** - Crawford has a weird problem where he's so much better than the rest of his division that he sometimes seems a bit underrated. Most people didn't see his first fight this year as very competitive despite Felix Diaz being a very good fighter with a gold medal. Conversely, Indongo's opposition hasn't been the best, but his shockingly quick rise through the 140lb rankings has captured a fair bit of attention. His first fight this year was a trouncing over () that led to him picking up his second title in as many fights. Which ever man wins will have the unique boxing achievement of being an undisputed champion and enough time left in the year to schedule a 3rd fight. The IBF has mandated that the winner must fight Sergey Lipinets next, and he's a pretty decent challenger to close out a year. If Indongo wins this I think he's the clear fighter of the year. If Crawford wins easily, there might be some doubt about how good Indongo really was, and the quality of his other wins might be questioned as well, but he's still a good candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**GGG/Canelo** - this is a big one, definitely the most significant single fight of the year, but you don't necessarily get fighter of the year off one event. There's probably not enough time for either of them to get another significant fight before the year is over, so whoever wins will be campaigning on 2 wins. Of the two, GGG's close win over Daniel Jacobs is worth more than Canelo's clean sweep over JCCJR in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mikey Garcia** - he's off to a great start with ending Dejan's life and ending Broner's career. The way he's been talking he clearly means business: dropping names like Linares and Lomachenko. If he finds his third big fight this year, likely Linares, he's got a very nice looking year.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Gervonta Davis** - Davis is on a schedule to give him 4 fights this year, and given the quality of his performances so far that could add to quite a bit. He'll be on the Mayweather undercard, which will give him a big audience. His currently negotiated opponent, ~~Rocky Martinez~~ Francisco Fonseca lacks a bit compared to previously considered opponents Orlando Salido and Tevin Farmer, but life comes at you fast. He'll likely fight again in fall and there's no shortage of good fighters at 130 to round out the year. It's also always nice to give recognition to somebody up and coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lomachenko** - The dude is obviously great, but the calendar year is not looking great for him so far. Sosa is decent and Marriega is meh, the only reason I consider him a possibility is that he might fight Rigo before the year's end, and a win there would have some pretty serious P4P implications. As a single fight idk if it's a better win than the GGG/Canelo winner sold have, but it's worth mentioning. Rigo's year so far has been bad enough that I think even beating Lomachenko wouldn't give him a chance here\n",
      "\n",
      "**Andre Ward** - He's considered by many to be the P4P #1 right now and he's coming off of his arguably most significant win. That said, he has no definite plans for the rest of the year. His camp has done a lot of talking about doing some fight at cruiserweight or heavyweight, which would be a pretty big deal if it happened. That said, I don't really see a path for him that's clearly better than what other fighters are accomplishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Anthony Joshua** - he's the biggest man in the biggest division, and his win over Wlad was both an amazing spectacle and a solid showcase of his abilities. His only other fight this year is likely to be against Pulev. Can you win FIghter of the year with those two fights? Probably not, but if they're both bangers he might deserve a mention.\n",
